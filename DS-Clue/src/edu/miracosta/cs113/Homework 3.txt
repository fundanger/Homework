Before implementation
How often do you get a solution in fewer than 20 guesses? Does this change depending on the theory you test (1, 2, 3)?
Since the algorithm randomly guesses every number until it gets the right number, it will rarely guess the correct answer in 20 guesses or fewer.
The theory doesn't matter since it doesn't start in any order.

What is good or bad about this strategy?
You can never efficiently guess the correct solution as there is no checking of each number, just random guessing.

After implementation
How often do you get a solution in fewer than 20 guesses? Does this change depending on the theory you test (1, 2, 3)?
You get a solution in fewer than 20 guesses regardless of which theory you test.

What is good or bad about this strategy?
The guessing is extremely efficient and ordered.
